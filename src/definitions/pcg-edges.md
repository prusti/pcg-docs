# PCG Hyperedges

A PCG Hyperedge is a directed edge of the form $\overline{n_s} \rightarrow
\overline{n_t}$, where elements of $\overline{n_s}$ and $\overline{n_t}$ are PCG
nodes. Hyperedges in the PCG are labelled with [validity
conditions](./validity-conditions.md)[^owned].

[^owned]: Currently not in the owned portion of the PCG, but this should happen eventually.
