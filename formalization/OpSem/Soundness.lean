-- chain — `DomainData`/`PcgData` are generic, so the export
-- doesn't auto-derive `Inhabited` for them. The
-- `requires contains(ar, l)` precondition guarantees the
-- index is always in bounds, so the default value is never
-- actually evaluated; we still provide a concrete inhabitant
-- so eager elaboration can't trip on `sorry`. The Lean exporter
-- mirrors this with an `extraLeanItems` entry so the generated
-- project type-checks too.

/-! # Soundness statement

This module is intentionally **not** part of the `OpSem` umbrella
(`OpSem.lean`). The `RustExport` driver imports `OpSem`, and pulling
PCG analysis machinery into that import chain shifts the registry
order in ways that mis-resolve unqualified `.deref` constructors
inside previously-working PCG modules — the same failure mode the
top-of-file comment in `RustExport.lean` calls out for `PCG.Obtain`.

Importing this file is therefore opt-in: `LeanExport` and
`PresentationExport` import it explicitly so the soundness
definitions appear in the generated Lean project and the LaTeX
presentation, while `RustExport` continues to see only the original
`OpSem` chain (these definitions are Prop-level and would be
filtered out of Rust output anyway). -/
