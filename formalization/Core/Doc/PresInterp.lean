/-! # `presBody!` — markdown-like body builder for `Presentation.elems`

A template `Presentation` value's `elems` field is a `List PresElement`,
where each element is either free-form prose (`PresElement.doc`) or a
reference to a registered DSL definition by short name
(`PresElement.defRef`). Hand-writing the list constructor is noisy:
the prose-vs-defRef boundary forces the writer to think in terms of
list-element shape rather than running text.

The `presBody!` macro lets the same value be written as a single
markdown-like interpolated string:

```lean
elems := presBody! "
  # Places

  A focused look at the `Place` definition and its
  transitive dependencies.

  [[Place]]

  Definitions referenced by `Place` but not embedded directly
  here are rendered in the Appendix below."
```

## Body grammar

* `[[Name]]` — emits `PresElement.defRef "Name"`. `Name` must parse as
  a bare Lean identifier (`isIdentStart` head, `isIdentCont` rest, no
  dots). Any other shape (unclosed `[[`, empty `[[]]`, non-identifier
  body, dotted body) is left as literal characters in the surrounding
  prose, matching the unclosed-`$`/unclosed-backtick fallback in
  `Doc.Interp`.
* `# ` at the start of a line (after optional whitespace) — emits
  `PresElement.doc (Doc.section <line content>)`. The `# ` prefix
  is stripped; the rest of the line is parsed with the same inline
  grammar as `doc!`. `[[Name]]` is *not* recognised inside a heading.
* `## ` at the start of a line — emits
  `PresElement.doc (Doc.subsection <line content>)`, with the same
  body-grammar rules as `# `.
* `### ` at the start of a line — emits
  `PresElement.doc (Doc.subsubsection <line content>)`, with the
  same body-grammar rules as `# `.
* `--` at the start of a line (after optional whitespace) — line
  comment: the entire line is dropped from the output, including any
  `[[Name]]` it contains (so commented-out defRefs do *not* register
  for export). Comment lines are invisible to paragraph splitting:
  they neither introduce a paragraph break nor interrupt the
  soft-line-break joining of the prose lines around them. Mid-line
  `--` is *not* a comment marker — it stays as literal text.
* A blank line (run of `\n`s with optional whitespace between them)
  — paragraph break: finalises the in-progress prose chunk into a
  single `PresElement.doc` and starts a new one.
* A single newline inside a paragraph collapses to a space (markdown
  single-newline behaviour).
* `{expr}` — Doc-value interpolation hole, semantics identical to
  `doc!`'s `{expr}`. The spliced value is added to the in-progress
  paragraph; it does not by itself break the paragraph.
* All other inline syntax — backtick code, `$math$`, `_italic_`,
  `__bold__`, `#name` / `#[name]` cross-refs — is delegated unchanged
  to the existing `doc!` segment parser
  (`Doc.Interp.parseSegs`).

An empty prose chunk between two non-prose tokens (e.g. two adjacent
`[[Name]]`s on the same line) is dropped rather than emitted as an
empty `Doc.seq`. -/

    `none` if `cs` does not start with `[[`, the closing `]]` is
    missing, the body is empty, or the body is not a bare
    identifier (mirrors `Doc.Interp.consumeRef`'s identifier
    rules: `isIdentStart` head, `isIdentCont` rest; no dots). -/

    a single `Doc.section` (or `Doc.subsection` / `Doc.subsubsection`)

    * a line whose first non-whitespace characters are `# ` /
      `## ` / `### ` → `heading <level> <inline-parsed body>`.
    * any other line → `tokenizeLine` (which produces `prose` and
      `defRefTok`s).

    Adjacent prose-bearing lines are joined by a single space, so
    soft line breaks (one `\n`) collapse to a space the way
    markdown handles them; the space is appended to the current
